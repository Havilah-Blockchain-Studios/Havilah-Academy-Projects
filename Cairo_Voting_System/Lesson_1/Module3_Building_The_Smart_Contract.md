# Building The Smart Contract

You have made it this far so let's keep going. Now we need to build this voting application. We already have an idea of what we want. These are:

- Submit proposal for users to vote for me
- Request for stake tokens to use and vote
- Vote for people

Sounds a bit easy right?.

Now let's cook!.

## Interface Section.

Now we have listed all those functions we need yes?. Now brainstorm with me. There are certain conditions we should take into account while creating these functions.

1. Submit proposal for users to vote for me
- We need users to create proposals and be able to know who created the proposal yes?

2. Request for stake tokens to use and vote
- We need tokens avaliable to be able to give out yes?

3. Vote for people
- We need to be able to put the tokens to vote for people.
